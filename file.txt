Yoshiko Sai's second effort opens a little more peculiarly, even ominously, than her first classic. 
For two minutes and 50 seconds it is the sitar and percussionist playing off each other with negative space in between. 
A stark contrast to the first album's opener, perhaps setting the stage for something completely different.

Luckily the beat comes in, the guitar, and then Yoshiko Sai's vocals!  
As powerful as ever. But in a way the theme was indeed a preview: 
The arrangements are stripped down here compared to Mangekyou. 
For better or worse depends on the listener, 
but it's an extremely interesting choice considering how many more people were involved with this project. 
The album is a lot slower than its predecessor, gloomy and meditative, really setting itself apart. 
Standout tracks in that regard are the wonderful opening suite, Haru (which seems to be Yoshiko Sai's answer to Hako Yamasaki's Wandering), Kinu no Michi, Hyouryuusen, and Mikkou.
